Description

For my final HTML/CSS project, I am excited to craft a responsive homepage reminiscent of what you might discover on a portfolio site. As I prepare to showcase my work and delve into job applications, I recognize the importance of presenting a polished portfolio. This project serves as an opportunity for me to apply and refine the advanced HTML and CSS concepts I've acquired.
